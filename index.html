			                <p> I'm a Master's Student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I have a Bachelor's degree in statistics from Hong Kong Baptist University. My research focuses on developing and applying statistical and deep learning models to genomic and single-cell data, aiming to uncover molecular mechanisms and cell-state heterogeneity through multimodal data integration. I am particularly interested in bridging modern inference with representation learning to understand complex biological systems such as Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
					
					<p> Previously, I have worked on projects involving cross-modal alignment of single-cell morphology and transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics–guided pathology modeling, and causal modeling of pediatric kidney function. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in statistics, computational biology, and data science, and enjoy building methods that combine theory, computation, and biology. </p>

		<strong>Integrating Single-Cell Morphology and Gene Expression for Cross-Modal Analysis</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed GeoAdVAE, a PyTorch-based geometry-aware adversarial autoencoder integrating neural cell morphology and transcriptomics via a novel multi-objective loss fusing adversarial network and Gromov–Wasserstein alignment. </li>
		<li> Designed the first known biologically interpretable simulation linking gene expression to neuronal morphology, providing insightful visualizations of pyramidal, bipolar, and multipolar neuron structures. </li>
		<li> Validated the model on real paired Patch-seq and simulated data under an unpaired integration setting, where our framework achieved an average ~20% higher cell-type alignment accuracy compared to 11 benchmark methods. </li>
		<li> Integrated unpaired morphology and transcriptomic data from distinct cohorts in Alzheimer’s dataset and performed cross-modal inference in the shared latent space, discovering morphology-linked genes associated with Alzheimer’s pathology. </li>
		<li> Presented research findings as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iy82r5AF1se86gy0glHxMBuV67iL7jcje6yCPcFgbRA/edit?usp=sharing">poster at the 2025 American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) in Boston.
		</ul>
		<strong>Analysis and Optimization of UAV Energy Consumption for Fog Computing</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed a fuzzy PID attitude control system to facilitate the UAV in accomplishing the tasks of takeoff, stable flight, and smooth landings. </li>
		<li> Proposed an anti-locking Ant Colony Optimization algorithm with decoupling and safety to identify the optimal path with an improving the convergence speed.</li>
		<li> Conducted stability testing of the model by simulating real-time UAV flight data and user’s computing demand data in Matlab. </li>
		<li> Analyzed the performance of the optimized implementation, achieving a ≥34% increase in total network consumption efficiency compared to an existing model. </li>
		</ul>
