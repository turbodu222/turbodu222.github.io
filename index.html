			                <p> I'm a Master's Student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I have a Bachelor's degree in statistics from Hong Kong Baptist University. My research experience includes developing a joint optimization model for healthcare resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I employed bionic algorithms to minimize mortality rates and resource costs. Additionally, I worked as a Data Analysis Intern at the National Bureau of Statistics in China, contributing to rural land use analysis and forecasting trends in the liquor purchasing managers' index. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging domain science, statistical models and programmatic data analysis. </p>

		<strong>Optimization of Healthcare Recourse Allocation During the COVID-19 Pandemic</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Development of a joint optimization model for healthcare resource allocation and patient transfers during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize the mortality rate and resource costs. </li>
		<li> Create a SIR-based SVUIR (Susceptible, Vaccinated, Unprotected, Infected and Recovered) model in R to compute the theoretical number of affected patients and patients who recovered from two doses of the vaccine.</li>
		<li> Apply bionic algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization to solve the model in Python; perform simulations with Bootstrap data sets to test the model’s performance and robustness.</li>
		<li> Achieve a 12% decrease in the mortality rate of affected patients compared with the benchmark.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Analysis and Optimization of UAV Energy Consumption for Fog Computing</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed a fuzzy PID attitude control system to facilitate the UAV in accomplishing the tasks of takeoff, stable flight, and smooth landings. </li>
		<li> Proposed an anti-locking Ant Colony Optimization algorithm with decoupling and safety to identify the optimal path with an improving the convergence speed.</li>
		<li> Conducted stability testing of the model by simulating real-time UAV flight data and user’s computing demand data in Matlab. </li>
		<li> Analyzed the performance of the optimized implementation, achieving a ≥34% increase in total network consumption efficiency compared to an existing model. </li>
		</ul>
